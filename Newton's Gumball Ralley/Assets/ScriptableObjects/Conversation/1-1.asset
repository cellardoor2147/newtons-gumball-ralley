      to our friend, Ralph. Click on the gumball machine to get your gumball. Then

      to the ground too fast. Gravity is an invisible force that pulls objects together. "

    content: Using the inclined plane to move the gumball towards Ralph gives the
      gumball more momentum, or strength that pushes something forward.
